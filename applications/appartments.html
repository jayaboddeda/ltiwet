                                ionized. Such ionized water acts as if it were soft water, which cannot form hard scale.
                                In addition, such ionized water peels off the scale inside pipes and prevents the
                                adhesion of scale and slime. As a result, formation of hard scale can be reduced.

                                As stated above, the reducing hardness of water is not the perfect way to prevent the
                                formation of hard scale. As long as silica and calcium are included in water, there is a
                                risk of scale formation as water becomes concentrated in the recirculation water flow
                                and therefore the concentration goes up at times and scale can be accumulated
                                incessantly. This is the reason why blow down of water and chemical feed should be
                                required for the circulation water flow like cooling towers and HVAC.

                                LTI can prevent formation of hard scale which is mentioned above without reducing
                                hardness of water. Of course, no blow down of water and chemical feed could be required.
                                The maintenance which also is only required is to wipe off the accumulated dry soft
                                colloids which have dropped in the sump pit.
