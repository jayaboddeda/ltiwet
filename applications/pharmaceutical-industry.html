                                between scales become looser and those scales can be scrapped off and detached naturally
                                without any force or device. Such a process is repeated and scales which have been stuck
                                to the inner tube of a boiler will disappear gradually.

                                The water goes into a boiler which is heated with burner flame and it will change into
                                steam which will get out of the boiler at some fixed pressure. As a matter of course,
                                steam going out of a boiler does not include any ionized minerals so the boiler water
                                will be concentrated gradually and scales will start to attach to the pipeline once such
                                concentration of water reaches the limit. To avoid such issues in the conventional
                                system, the softener is installed at the water supply line and hardness component is
                                absorbed and removed by the ion exchange resin. However, such ion exchange resin will
                                cease to be effective in absorbing hardness component unless it is cleaned by back
                                washing with salty water. In addition to the cleansing process above, other processes
                                including scale removal and prevention of corrosion using the boiler compound and
                                deoxygenating agent need to be conducted while the concentrated boiler water needs to be
                                discharged from the bottom blow valve on a periodical basis. Regardless of such
                                processes being conducted, the quantity of scales attached to the pipeline will increase
                                unless the periodical cleansing process for the pipeline is made consistently. The
                                installation of LTI would make it possible for none of the above-mentioned process of
                                cleansing including back washing and chemical feed to be required, which can lead to
                                less maintenance efforts and the cost reduction. However, blow down process of the
                                concentrated water should of course be required.

                                The trial for the cooling tower can be conducted as illustrated above.<br>
                                With the installation of the device, water in the tank can be recirculated going through
                                the device at multiple times a day. Please note this trial should be easy one: just a
                                submerged pump should be required and nothing in the existing line is required to be
                                changed so this trial can be accepted by your customers easily.
